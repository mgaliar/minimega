    Do we need additional documentation for: ui, util, vlan?

### Store

The phenix tool uses a data store as the storage service for all of data needed throughout the various capabilities. Some important considerations are worth understanding prior to working with phenix.

1. If you are running as a standard user, the store is created in your home directory by default.
2. If you are running as a root user, the default location will be `/etc/phenix/store.bdb`.
3. It is possible to configure the store endpoint either by including the location as a flag with each command using `--store.endpoint <string>`.
4. Finally, there are global values that can be set in a YAML file; see the [config documentation](configuration.md) for more information.
