# User Administration in phÄ“nix

## Create a new user

There are two primary ways to create new users. 

1. Choose the `Create Account` link off the login page and complete all fields
   one the `Create a New Account` dialogue. This will initiate a message to an
   administrator's account who can then activate the account, setting the
   role(s) and resource name(s).

2. From the `Users` tab, click the `+` button to `create a new user`. Here the
   administrator will add the role(s) and resource name(s).

## Login

The login page is self-descriptive. Using the `Remember me` checkbox will set a 
token to local storage so that you can remove the requirement to enter a `Username` 
and `Password` each time the page or site is reloaded. 

If an administrator starts the UI server with the following command, authentication 
is enabled:

```
$> phenix ui -k <some_string>
```

Without the `-k` (or `--jwt-signing-key`), authentication is disabled.

## User Administration

### Updating users

An administrator is able to click on the username on the table in the Users tab to 
update a user. They can update `First Name` or `Last Name`, `Role`, or `Resource Name(s)`.

### Role

`Global Admin` is the administrator level account and has access to all capabilities, 
to include user management. They also have access to all resources.

Key: E - experiment resource, V - VM resource, U - user resource
