#================================== Flows =====================================

# Set `enabled: false` or comment out all options to disable flows reporting.

#============================== Dashboards =====================================

# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here or by using the `setup` command.

#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:
  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
